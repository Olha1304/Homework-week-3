        Yoga has become a go-to ritual for many of us recentlyâ€”for good reason: Including the practice in your wellness routine can offer several benefits to the mind and body, such as stress relief, preventing joint pain and stiffness, and improving flexibility, balance, and mental clarity and focus. It could even help with weight loss, research suggests. And there's no easier way to build a practice that fits your lifestyle than with a yoga app.
